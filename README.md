# 🔍 Graph Visualization with Search Algorithms

An interactive and animated graph visualizer built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Easily create custom graphs and visualize traversal using 

**Breadth-First Search (BFS)**, **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, and **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)** algorithms.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Drag-and-drop node placement
- ✅ Add/remove nodes and edges dynamically
- ✅ Set edge costs (for UCS)
- ✅ Animate traversal step-by-step
- ✅ Highlight visited and path nodes
- ✅ Clean and responsive UI
- ✅ No external libraries

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Open in Browser

Just open the `index.html` file in any modern browser:

open index.html  # macOS
start index.html # Windows

No installation or build required!

## 🧠 Algorithms Included

- **BFS** – Explores neighbors level by level.
- **DFS** – Goes deep before backtracking.
- **UCS** – Chooses the lowest cost path at each step.

## 🛠 Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
